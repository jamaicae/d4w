    <h2 id="top">Political History</h2>
    
     <p>The people involved in politics in Ultimo/ Pyrmont have almost always been Labor members. Well known politicians include Charlie Hackett, John Armstrong, the Molloys, Jack Byrne, the Fegans, Bob Frazer, Cyril Carroll and Peter La Fontaine. Therefore, the Labor Party had an immediate, grassroots in the Ultimo and Pyrmont area. For the people of the Ultimo/ Pyrmont area, they looked to their aldermen for jobs and local life. Up until 1967, five hundred local boys were employed by the City Council to begin their careers in the Town Hall administration. For the local lives, the Town Hall cars would be utilised to help the people, such as collecting a relative from the hospital or carrying mourners at a funeral. </p>

    <h3>Notable Politicians</h3>
    
    <h4> Bob McKinney</h4>
    <p>Bob McKinney was born in Pyrmont in 1901. By the time he was 15, he had prominent roles in local sport clubs as secretary, where he would remain a significant member for the next 30 years. Apart from sports, he had a lifelong association with Labor politics. He was an executive officer with the Printing Industry Employees’ Union and the executive officer for the Municipal and Shire Employees Union. He later served as a delegate for the Australian Labor Party’s annual conferences. It is suggested that he could have had an illustrious career in Labor politics if not for his habit if stepping aside for other politicians. It was stated that he “was too nice of a man to mix it in politics”.</p>
    
    <section class="col-2-3">
    <h4>Jack Byrne</h4>
    <p>Between 1950 to 1962, Jack Byrne represented Ultimo on the Council. As a politician, he was often known to have spoken his mind, took no nonsense and expected those around him to meet his own exacting standards. He was Lord Mayor in 1950, 1952 and 1959. His most important and prominent contribution to Ultimo and Pyrmont was saving the residential stock. In the late 1940’s to early 1950’s, there were plans and pressures to eliminate all the residential areas and give it over to industries. Jack Byrne interrupted this scheme, against the opinion of the State Government, industrialists, professional planners and newspaper commentators.</p>
