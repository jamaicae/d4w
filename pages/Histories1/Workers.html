    <h3>Hydraulic Pumpkins Station</h3>
    <p> The Hydraulic Pumping Station powered all of the woolpresses, and many of the wharf cranes, lifts and bank doors in Sydney. However, most of it has now been dismantled and removed, with the only a few of the machinery still operating. The hydraulic power system was previously associated with the wool industry, the dockyards, and linked to the commercial buildings in Sydney. Because it was the main pumping station of the system, the workers had a significant role in the industrial and commercial development of Sydney. </p>

    <h3>The Davey Flour Mill</h3>
    
    <img class="imgleft" src="../../images/daveyflour.jpg" id="wrapped" title="Davey's Flour Mill" alt="Davey's Flour Mill" width="320px" align="right">
    
    
    <p>This flourmill, pictured on the right, is still functioning as a bulk flourmill. It is now operating as part of the N.B. Love Flour Company whose headquarters are in Enfield. Edwin Davey bought a building in 1907 in Ultimo and began a mill business. After a fire in 1911, it was rebuilt and was added a new western section. At first, the mill only held three tons of flour in its capacity per hour. However, by the 1950s, 46 bags of flour could be field per hour. Initially, horses were used to carry the bags from Ultimo, but were eventually replaced by workers and trucks in the 1930s. The workforce was about 25 for each of the three daily shifts. </p>
    
    <h3>Chinatown</h3>
    <p>The bulk of Chinatown falls within the Ultimo region, with the streets surrounding the area consisting of fifty Chinese restaurants and a score of produce shops. The workers are predominantly Chinese, with much of the population making its home in Ultimo. The previous primary schools had a Chinese teaching aide and the Fegan centre, a Chinese youth worker. Since the establishment of Chinatown, the City Council and the Chinese community contributed to the making of the Dixon Street Mall, with the chairman and the secretary of the committee both being of Chinese descent. </p>

    <h3>Dairy Farmers</h3>
    
    <img class="imgleft" title="Dairy Farmers" alt="Dairy Farmers" id="wrapped" src="../../images/dairyfarm.jpg" width="280" align="right">
    
    <p>Organised dairying in NSW began in 1795, when stray cattle were found grazing in the “Cow Pastures”, the then richest lands in the colony. The founder of Pyrmont, Captain John Macarthur had escaped trial for a mutiny, and was given 10,000 acres by the Governor of the Colony, and thirty convicts to use for work.</p>
    
    <p>In 1825, he took 14 female convicts to work as dairymaids. This began the first of dairy farmers in Sydney.In 1900, decades later, a group of dairymen from the South Coast met and formed a Dairy Farmers Co-operative, where they transported milk for sale, initially using Redfern as their base, before purchasing a two-storey building in Harris Street (pictured on the right), and gradually expanded their site along Harris Street and Ultimo Road. Currently, milk is brought overnight to Ultimo from all over New South Wales, which provides daily milk for most of Sydney. </p>

    <h3>Burley Griffin Incinerator</h3>
    <p>From 1901, the City Council operated an incinerator in Moore Park to burn garbage. However, by 1932, there were demands for the construction of a new incinerator, with the capacity to burn 110 tons of garbage per day. Eventually, the new incinerator was located to Pyrmont. </p>
  
    <h3>Paddy’s Market</h3>
    <p>Previously, Paddy’s Market was located in the Queen Victoria Building but since the beginning of the last century, it has since been moved to the expansive buildings in Haymarket,  a part of Ultimo. Workers brought fish, tobacco, meat, fruit and vegetables by rail and truck from country centres to Haymarket. The produce was then dispersed to workers within the market and sold throughout Sydney. In September 1975, the opening of Flemington’s Market in Sydney’s West threatened the future of Paddy’s Market and their workers, as well as inner city residents, as workers and residents could all easily commute to the central markets as part of their daily life. </p>
    
    <h3>The Fish Market</h3>
    <p>Previously, the fishing industry constructed of a “catch and sell your own” situation. However, after 1945, the Registry of Co-operative societies was handed the task of forming a co-operative system for NSW fisherman, and ensure central marketing. In 1963, the Fish Markets were opened in Haymarket, Ultimo (although in 1966, they would relocate to Blackwattle Bay), and all fisherman and workers sold fish in Sydney. </p>
