    <h2 id="top">Indigenous History</h2>
    
    <p>Before the colonisation of Australia, the Gadigal people of the Eora tribe of Indigenous Aboriginals inhabited the Ultimo area they called Pirrama. The Eora name was given to the coastal Aboriginal people that inhabited Sydney. The word Eora means “here” or “from this place” and the Indigenous people simple used the term to describe to the British colonisers where they came from, and therefore, the word was used to define the Aboriginal inhabits themselves. </p>
    
    <p>Today, Central Sydney, especially the area of Ultimo, is often referred to as “Eora Country”. After the British settlement, the Aboriginal people were slowly decimated from the region. However, there are still descendants of the Eora tribe still living in the Sydney region.</p>
        
    <p>It is believed that the main thoroughfares that surround Ultimo, such as George Street, followed Aboriginal tracks that had served as trading routes between farmed grasslands and fishing areas. There is evidence that suggests Aboriginal people were forced to further out to Redfern, Centennial Park and South Head to access clean drinking water, after their local water source that was polluted by the British invaders. However, evidence suggests a number of Indigenous people continuing to live in Pyrmont up to the 1870s, for the fresh springs, allowing them to stay near their initial area they dwelled in. </p>

    <p>In Ultimo specifically, there are references that suggest the Indigenous tribes gathered for ceremonies in the area.  Eventually, in the 1930s, places like Pyrmont and Ultimo became places that the Indigenous could live and work in. During the 1960s, government legislations changed and provided freedom of movement, which enabled more Aboriginal people to choose to live in the Pyrmont/ Ultimo area.</p>
